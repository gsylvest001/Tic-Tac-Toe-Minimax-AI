# Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax-AI
Project which uses mini-max algorithm with alpha beta pruning to play tic tac toe.

This project allows the user to play against an AI or another human.
The AI uses minimax with alpha beta pruning to choose the best action to play.
There is an easy mode which searches up to depth 2, a medium mode which searches up to depth 3 and a grand master which searches up to depth 9.

Got some graphical ideas for game from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM
